"Independent Study and Research - II"

---


I performed a commentary analysis and observational study on the Female Pima Indians Dataset for Diabetes. Details about the data-set itself is available at [here](kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). Specific details about the variables themselves, and the sampling of the records from volunteers, etc have been included in the RPubs document (Tab 1.1)

- Part 1 is all about a statistical approach to the data-set, exploring the data and proposing and finding the best statistical models possible to predict if a Pima Indian female has diabetes or not.
- Part 2 is about using a k-NN classifier and a logistic regression classifier(yet again) for the prediction.


- Part 1 has been done using R.
- Part 2 has been done using Python.


The RPub document is actually a published RMarkdown document, generated using the "knitr" package in RStudio, the go-to IDE with R.
